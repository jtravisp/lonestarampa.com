## Sergeant Pollard's Tips

- You can **ONLY** play **alto** or **tenor** sax. (No bari, soprano, C melody, etc.)
- Choose a selection from each of these three styles:
  - Classical Etude/Solo
  - Swing/Bebop
  - Rock/Funk
- Don't use a backing track. Too much can go wrong with the tech, including balance on the recording.
  - If you decide to use a backing track, you can only use one on one selection.
- Rehearse playing through the entire AMPA from beginning to end. It's easy to fool yourself into thinking you've got a selection nailed, but it will feel different when you're playing the whole audition at once.
- I tend to lean towards etudes over solo rep since it's easier to find a good 30-45 second selection to showcase your ability.
- Watch out for "high risk/high reward" music, e.g. if your altissimo isn't 100%, don't go for it during the AMPA. Play to your strengths.
  - Also avoid music that the instructor will have heard 1,000 times, e.g. Bird "Confirmation" transcription or the Ibert Concerto.
- I recommend using one or two condenser mics, but don't put the mic too close to your horn (at least 3' away). You want some of the natural room reverb (since you can't edit the recording) and a high quality recording of your sound, but not the details of your key noise or other imperfections in your sound that will be picked up if the mic is too close. Ideally record and listen to a sample and adjust as needed.
- See the doc above for recommended selections, but you don't have to choose from that list. **Some of my favorites:**
  - **Classical**
    - Bozza: 12 Etudes-Caprices
    - Piazzolla: Tango Etudes
    - Caravan: Bach for the Saxophone (Cello Suites, etc)
    - Marcel Mule: Etudes Variees
  - **Swing/Bebop** (According to the regs- if you play your own transcription, you must provide a reference recording. If yo play a commercially available transcription, you must provide the sheet music.)
    - Charlie Parker Omnibook
    - Brubeck Transcription
    - Saxophone Omnibook (Hal Leonard) transcription selection (lots of choices)
    - Fishman Jazz Etudes are good if you're less experienced/confident with swing style
  - **Rock/Funk**
    - Mintzer Funk Etudes (variety of difficulties)
    - Funk Transcription, e.g. Grover Washington Jr
    - Brecker transcription if you're feeling bold
